# chess-count-quiz
Simple website that quizzes you on the number of possible chess moves.

The hope is that this is good practice for board vision.  Beginners at chess are
often advised to consider their and their opponent's moves, and checks and captures
in particular.  The first step in this is noticing what these moves are.

You can also practice visualization by having it give you a few future moves
to consider.  Then you have to enter the counts assuming those moves have been
played.

Misc note: all of the positions where castling or en passant are available have
been filtered out already.  So don't include these moves in your counts.

Thanks to [Lichess](https://lichess.org/) for their open puzzle
database and for generally being a great free website, and the user
GnocchiPup on that site who explained the benefit of move counting to me.
